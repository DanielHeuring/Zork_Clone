He questions you on what you are doing in his office until he notices the answer key in your hand.
You attempt to run but the door slams shut and you cannot pry in open. You turn
around and Dr. Buck has a deck of cards on his desk  and asks if you want to play.
He challanges you to a game of blackjack.
---hint---
This game of blackjack is a version where each hand determines who and how much damage is dealt. Your goal is to reduce Dr. Buck's health from 50 to zero before he does the same to your 65 health. Winning a hand deals damage to Dr. Buck based on the difference in card values, while losing means you take the damage. Strategically decide when to hit or stand, and avoid busting to ensure your survival!

---------Instructions---------
- Navigate the halls using commands like 'go north', 'go south', 'up', or 'down'.
- Inspect rooms to find items and uncover hidden details.
- Use 'grab <item>' to pick up an item after inspecting.
- Actions in rooms can be 'talk', 'unlock', or 'use <item name>', with more that can be discovered
- Manage your items using 'backpack' to check what you've collected.
- Type help into the prompt at anytime to get useful commands!
- In order to leave the game just type leave game.
- Your goal is to explore, find items, and steal the final answer keys.!
