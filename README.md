General Overview:
	The game begins with the player in their dorm room tasked with finding the purpose of their life while exploring the crazy world of college. The player is then prompted on what they would like to do next. As they explore the campus, they encounter various obstacles, puzzles, trials, and monsters (Professors, TA, Students). The game is adventure so the end goal is unclear. As the student explores and runs find different things. They may enter the bookstore and buy books that allow them to go to different classes. As the player explores they may wander off campus and end up at a party and gain untold items into their bag. As the student progresses they may run into professors demanding homework for a class or forcing them into different labs. Depending on the performance on homework, labs, and out-of-class activities. They develop a sense of who they are. Ultimately, success in the game is determining what path the student wants to follow. If that involves getting a degree or dropping out is entirely up to the choices the user makes. 

Gameplay Aspects:
Freeroam: The player has the ability to explore the whole world as long as they have the proper tools in their inventories. This will be done by prompting the player to enter a command on what should be done next. For example, “You are in Kirby Student Center and there is a group of people playing pool. What do you want to do?” The user may input travel south or try joining the group of students playing pool. And then this process would repeat until the user finds their purpose in college.


Items: In certain rooms when the user inputs the correct command an item may be attained that allows the user to access more areas of the game. However, the amount of items the user can hold is limited by the amount of space they have. For example, in the professor's office, the user may find the professor's keys, allowing them to access locked doors. 

Ending: After the user successfully fulfills all of the faculty's requests and their own needs, they may find their way out of the school and receive a diploma and a sense of purpose for their life before the game draws to a close.
